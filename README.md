</p>
It’s my first ever unity game that I fully developed by myself. *The first game is just like the first pancake* - it’s probably not the best one, I am aware of that.
<br>
This game is a platformer Mario-like. You play as an azure dinosaur called Azoo, who travels the prehistoric world to help free oppressed dodo birds.
