# What’s going on?
<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/Karol-2/Jurrassic_Run/blob/main/Readme_content/frame.png" alt="frame.png"> </p>
It’s my first ever unity game that I fully developed by myself. <i> The first game is just like the first pancake </i>- it’s probably not the best one, I am aware of that.
This game is a platformer Mario-like. You play as an azure dinosaur called Azoo, who travels the prehistoric world to help free oppressed dodo birds.
